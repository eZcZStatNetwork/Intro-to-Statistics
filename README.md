# Intro-to-Statistics

Welcome to the eZcZ Stat Network's Intro to Statistics. Over the next 3-4 months, I will be uploading videos on the eZcZSN 
Youtube channel to help students taking courses such as: Intro to Stat, Intro to Business/Engineering Stats, etc.
This repository will serve as a resource for any slides used in my videos, external resources that I think are worth looking at, datasets used in the videos, and much more.

I hope you enjoy! -- please remember to subscribe to and share the channel.
